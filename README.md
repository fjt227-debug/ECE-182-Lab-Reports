# ECE-182-Lab-Reports
ECE 182 is a hands-on circuits laboratory course focused on the analysis, simulation, and implementation of analog and digital electronic circuits. The course emphasizes connecting circuit theory to real-world behavior through analytical calculations, physical circuit construction on breadboards, and experimental validation. LabVIEW was used to model and analyze digital circuit behavior and signal interactions. Each laboratory experiment involved measuring circuit responses using standard instrumentation such as oscilloscopes, multimeters, and power supplies. The work in this repository demonstrates practical experience in circuit debugging, verification, and technical documentation.
